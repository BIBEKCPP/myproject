## SWORD II: ADVENTURE OF FROG
A small game made entirely on live stream over about 15 hours.
I intend to add more documentation and clarify some of the code and assets over the next few days.

### links
 - [windows build](https://github.com/NoelFB/tiny_link/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
 - [stream archive](https://twitch.tv/noelfb)
 
### building
  - You need C++17 and CMake
  - Make sure you have SDL2 headers & libraries, and make sure CMake can find them
  - All the art was made in [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). To modify or add new sprites, you'll need to use aseprite.
